# Cursor AI Rules for The Big Screen Club

## Git Commit Guidelines

### NEVER Bypass Git Hooks
- **NEVER** use `--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or any flag that skips git hooks when committing
- Pre-commit hooks exist for a reason (linting, type checking, tests)
- If the pre-commit hook fails:
  1. Read and understand the errors
  2. Fix all linting errors shown in the output
  3. Fix all type errors
  4. Fix all test failures
  5. Stage the fixes and retry the commit
- Do not commit until all hooks pass successfully
- If fixing the errors would take too long or is complex, inform the user and ask for guidance

### Handling Pre-commit Hook Failures
When a pre-commit hook fails:
1. **Read the error output carefully** - it shows exactly what needs to be fixed
2. **Fix ESLint errors** by:
   - Removing unused variables
   - Adding proper type assertions
   - Fixing strict boolean expression checks
   - Following the project's linting rules
3. **Fix TypeScript errors** by:
   - Adding proper type definitions
   - Fixing type mismatches
   - Ensuring all imports are correct
4. **Stage the fixes** with `git add`
5. **Retry the commit** WITHOUT any bypass flags

### Example: DO NOT DO THIS
```bash
# WRONG - Never bypass hooks
git commit --no-verify -m "message"
git commit -n -m "message"
```

### Example: DO THIS INSTEAD
```bash
# RIGHT - Fix the errors, then commit normally
# 1. Fix the linting/type errors in the files
# 2. Stage the fixes
git add .
# 3. Commit normally (hooks will run)
git commit -m "message"
```

## Code Quality Standards
- All commits must pass linting
- All commits must pass type checking
- Maintain the existing code style and patterns
- No warnings should be introduced
- Keep the codebase clean and maintainable
